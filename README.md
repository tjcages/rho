# Rho Front-End Marketing Challenge

## Approach

1. **Code Organization**: Structured code in a modular & organized way, using a component-based approach for reusability & maintainability.

2. **Responsive Design**: Ensured full responsiveness for desktop & mobile devices using media queries.

3. **Fluid Experience**: Made the landing page look & feel smooth with snapping for desktop but standard scrolling for mobile.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) – say less?

5. **Animations**: Added [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) animations & transitions to narrow a user's focus to only the currently applicable element.

Focused on best practices for front-end development, responsiveness, accessibility, performance optimization, & animations to enhance the user experience. To build a maintainable system for longevity & future simplicity, I made slight improvements to the original design.
